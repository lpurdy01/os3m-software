# OS3M Mouse Software
![](desktop_app_demo.png?raw=true)

This repository houses the software used on the PC side for supporting the OS3M mouse. Right now the only supported API is SolidWorks, but I've written the code to be extensible to any other application with a C++ API. Please create issues for other software you would like supported and hopefully myself or others will write adapters for it!
